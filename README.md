Total there are 5 files in which my code is there in polyomial.java file.
I have written my code in polynomial.java and after compiling the file polynomial.class is created. The testcases 1 and 2 are in the testcase1.json and testcase2.json files respectively. To open json files i have included jar file in the same folder for opening json files. I have compiled using this line "javac -cp .;json-20210307.jar polynomial.java" and I have executed using this line "java -cp .;json-20210307.jar polynomial".
I have used Lagrange interpolation method in my code
This is the output:
Secret from first JSON file: 3
Secret from second JSON file: 79836264049851
